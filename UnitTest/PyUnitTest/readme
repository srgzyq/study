Where to place testing code
The test module can be run standalone from the command line
The test code can more easily be separated from shipped code
There is less temptation to change test code to fit the code it tests without a good reason
Test code should be modified much less frequently than the code it tests
Tested code can be refactored more easily
Tests for modules written in C must be in separate modules anyway, so why not be consistent?
If the testing strategy changes, there is no need to change the source code
